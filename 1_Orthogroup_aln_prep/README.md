# Phylogenomic data preparation

We combined the phylogenomic data from Cai et al. 2019 (Malpighiales WGD) and Cai et al. 2021 (Malpighiales phylogeny) with the following steps.

1. Based on the gene IDs of three species commonly sampled in the two studies (Manihot esculenta, Populus trichocarpa, and Jatropha curcas), a preliminary one-2-one ortholog mapping was generated. This one-2-one mapping is provided in `malpighiales_sapria_orthogroup.list`.

2.
